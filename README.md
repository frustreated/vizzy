#Vizzy Flash Tracer
Vizzy Flash Tracer shows debug trace of SWF files without adding any extra code. It works in Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Flash IDE, Adobe AIR and other places where trace statements exist. Vizzy is cross-platform and has all features that a developer requires for a comfortable and fast debugging.

Vizzy runs out-of-the-box and configures your environment for you to start debugging your flash applications immediately (automatic mm.cfg file creation, determining location, debug flash player detection, etc.)
